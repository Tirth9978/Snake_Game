# Snake_Game
The Snake Game is a modern implementation of a classic arcade game, designed as part of the IT206: Data Structures Lab (Winter 2024-25). The project leverages advanced programming concepts, including Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) and data structures, to create an engaging and extensible gaming experience.The player controls a snake that grows with each piece of food consumed, navigating a grid-based game area while avoiding collisions. This project emphasizes modularity, performance, and extensibility, allowing for seamless future enhancements.

<h2>
  Features:
</h2>
<p>
  Grid-Based Gameplay: A structured grid where the snake moves and food spawns.
  Keyboard Controls: Players can use W/A/S/D or arrow keys to direct the snake.
  Score Tracking: Displays current and final scores.
  Collision Detection: Ends the game on collisions with self or boundaries.
  Restart Option: Allows restarting the game after a game over.
</p>
<h2>
  Technical Highlights:
</h2>
<p>
  OOP Concepts: Classes for Snake, Food, and GameBoard.
  Data Structures: Queue or Linked List for snake representation and arrays for the grid.
  Extensibility: Designed for future enhancements like obstacles or levels.
</p>
<h2>
  Gameplay Instructions:
</h2>
<p>
  Start the game and control the snake using W/A/S/D or arrow keys.
  The snake grows each time it consumes food, and the score increases accordingly.
  Avoid collisions with the snake's body or the grid boundaries to stay alive.
  When the game ends, your final score will be displayed. Restart or exit as desired.
