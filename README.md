## Introduction
This project is a console-based Snake Game implemented in C++. It follows an object-oriented approach using classes and inheritance to manage game components like the snake, fruit, and game board.

## Features
- Grid-based gameplay.
- Snake movement using keyboard controls.
- Normal and special fruits for scoring.
- Obstacles appear as the game progresses.
- Wall collision mode (can be enabled or disabled).
- Dynamic difficulty adjustment.
- Clear UI with instructions and score tracking.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/snake-game.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```sh
   cd snake-game
   ```
3. Compile the code using g++ (for Linux/macOS):
   ```sh
   g++ -o snake_game snake_game.cpp
   ```
   For Windows (using MinGW):
   ```sh
   g++ -o snake_game.exe snake_game.cpp
   ```
4. Run the executable:
   ```sh
   ./snake_game  # (Linux/macOS)
   snake_game.exe  # (Windows)
   ```

## How to Play
- Control the snake using **W, A, S, D** or **arrow keys**.
- Eat fruits (@ for normal, $ for special) to grow the snake and increase the score.
- Avoid hitting the walls (if enabled) and obstacles (#).
- Game over if the snake collides with itself or an obstacle.
- After the game ends, you can restart or exit.

## Game Controls
| Key   | Action |
|-------|--------|
| W / Up Arrow   | Move Up |
| S / Down Arrow | Move Down |
| A / Left Arrow | Move Left |
| D / Right Arrow | Move Right |
| P | Pause |
| R | Resume |
| X | Reset Game |
| ESC | Exit Game |

## Game Mechanics
- The snake moves continuously in the last chosen direction.
- Eating a **normal fruit** (@) increases the score by **5 points**.
- Eating a **special fruit** ($) increases the score by **20 points**.
- Once the score reaches **50**, obstacles start appearing.
- The difficulty dynamically increases as the score rises.

## Code Structure
The game is implemented using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles:

- **`Game` (Base Class)**: Defines the core game logic and properties.
- **`Snake` (Inherits from Game)**: Handles the snake’s position and movement.
- **`Fruit` (Inherits from Snake)**: Manages fruit generation.
- **`Main` (Inherits from Fruit)**: Controls the game loop, rendering, and input handling.

## Data Structure Analysis
### Data Structures Used:
- **Arrays (`int *Tail_X, *Tail_Y`)**:
  - Used to store the position of the snake's tail dynamically.
  - Allows flexible snake growth by increasing memory allocation.

- **Vector (`vector<pair<int, int>> obstacles`)**:
  - Stores positions of randomly generated obstacles.
  - Enables efficient obstacle placement and collision detection.

- **Enum (`enum direction`)**:
  - Represents movement directions (`LEFT`, `RIGHT`, `UP`, `DOWN`, `STOP`).
  - Makes direction control easy and readable.

### Object Structure:
- `Game` class initializes **width, height, score, and game state**.
- `Snake` class extends `Game` by adding **snake movement and tail handling**.
- `Fruit` class extends `Snake` to **generate food at random locations**.
- `Main` class controls **game logic, collision handling, rendering, and input processing**.

## Future Enhancements
- Implementing **multiple levels** with increasing complexity.
- Adding a **high score tracking system**.
- Introducing **AI-controlled snakes** as opponents.
- Creating a **GUI-based version** using a graphics library.
