## 📖 Introduction
   This project is a console-based Snake Game implemented in C++. It follows an object-oriented approach using classes and inheritance to manage game components like the snake, fruit, and game board.

## ✨ Features
- 🎯 Grid-based gameplay.
- 🎮 Snake movement using keyboard controls.
- 🍏 Normal and special fruits for scoring.
- 🚧 Obstacles appear as the game progresses.
- 🧱 Wall collision mode (can be enabled or disabled).
- 🔄 Dynamic difficulty adjustment.
- 📺 Clear UI with instructions and score tracking.

## ⚙️ Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/Tirth9978/Snake_Game.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```sh
   cd Snake_Game
   ```
3. Compile the code using g++ (for Linux/macOS):
   ```sh
   g++ -o main main.cpp
   ```
   For Windows (using MinGW):
   ```sh
   g++ -o main.exe main.cpp
   ```
4. Run the executable:
   ```sh
   ./main  # (Linux/macOS)
   main.exe  # (Windows)
   ```

## 🎮 How to Play
- Control the snake using **W, A, S, D** or **arrow keys**.
- 🍏 Eat fruits (@ for normal, $ for special) to grow the snake and increase the score.
- 🚧 Avoid hitting the walls (if enabled) and obstacles (#).
- ☠️ Game over if the snake collides with itself or an obstacle.
- 🔄 After the game ends, you can restart or exit.

## 🎯 Game Controls
| 🎮 Key   | 🏹 Action |
|-------|--------|
| W / ⬆️ Up Arrow   | Move Up |
| S / ⬇️ Down Arrow | Move Down |
| A / ⬅️ Left Arrow | Move Left |
| D / ➡️ Right Arrow | Move Right |
| ⏸️ P | Pause |
| ▶️ R | Resume |
| 🔄 X | Reset Game |
| ❌ ESC | Exit Game |

## 🕹️ Game Mechanics
- The 🐍 snake moves continuously in the last chosen direction.
- 🍏 Eating a **normal fruit** (@) increases the score by **5 points**.
- 💰 Eating a **special fruit** ($) increases the score by **20 points**.
- 🚧 Once the score reaches **50**, obstacles start appearing.
- 🔼 The difficulty dynamically increases as the score rises.

## 💡 Code Structure
The game is implemented using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles:

- **🛠️ `Game` (Base Class)**: Defines the core game logic and properties.
- **🐍 `Snake` (Inherits from Game)**: Handles the snake’s position and movement.
- **🍏 `Fruit` (Inherits from Snake)**: Manages fruit generation.
- **🎮 `Main` (Inherits from Fruit)**: Controls the game loop, rendering, and input handling.

## 📊 Data Structure Analysis
### 📂 Data Structures Used:
- **📌 Arrays (`int *Tail_X, *Tail_Y`)**:
  - Used to store the position of the snake's tail dynamically.
  - Allows flexible snake growth by increasing memory allocation.

- **📊 Vector (`vector<pair<int, int>> obstacles`)**:
  - Stores positions of randomly generated obstacles.
  - Enables efficient obstacle placement and collision detection.

- **🔢 Enum (`enum direction`)**:
  - Represents movement directions (`LEFT`, `RIGHT`, `UP`, `DOWN`, `STOP`).
  - Makes direction control easy and readable.

### 🔍 Object Structure:
- `Game` class initializes **width, height, score, and game state**.
- `Snake` class extends `Game` by adding **snake movement and tail handling**.
- `Fruit` class extends `Snake` to **generate food at random locations**.
- `Main` class controls **game logic, collision handling, rendering, and input processing**.

## 🚀 Future Enhancements
- 🎮 Implementing **multiple levels** with increasing complexity.
- 👥 We can add **Multiplayer Mode** where two players can play with their own snakes.
- 🏆 Adding a **high score tracking system**.
- 🤖 Introducing **AI-controlled snakes** as opponents.
- 🎨 Creating a **GUI-based version** using a graphics library.
